### Brief History

While there had been numerous versions of this puzzle dating back to 1894 in France, The modern day version of the puzzle is believed to be created by Howard Garns in 1979 in the United States. The puzzle was then introduced to Japan in 1984 where it was initially named Sūji wa dokushin ni kagiru (数字は独身に限る), which can be translated as "the digits must be single". It was later abbreviated to Sudoku (数独). 

In 1997, Wayne Gould of Hong Kong began development of a computer program that would rapidly generate unique puzzles. In 2004 Sudoku was finally published in The Times in Britain, where is has since gained world-wide popularity. Over the years Sudoku has since moved from only print onto digital platforms ranging from web browser games, mobile phone apps, and video game consoles.
